I am a dedicated and results-driven professional with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Information Technology (BBIT) and a specialization in cybersecurity. My educational journey has provided me with a robust foundation in both technical and business principles, enabling me to navigate the complexities of the IT landscape effectively. Throughout my studies, I developed expertise in ethical hacking, networking, and AI engineering, and I became proficient in programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, Java, and Python. This diverse skill set positions me uniquely to tackle contemporary challenges in the tech industry.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
