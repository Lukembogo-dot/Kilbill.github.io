My professional experience has been equally enriching. I have had the opportunity to work with notable organizations, including the Kenya Academy of Sports and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). At the Kenya Academy of Sports, I gained hands-on experience in project coordination and data management, supporting various sports programs and initiatives. This role taught me the importance of efficient operations and effective teamwork in achieving organizational goals.

While working as a clerk at IEBC, I was involved in critical processes such as data management and voter registration. This experience enhanced my attention to detail and allowed me to contribute to the integrity of electoral operations in Kenya. I learned how to work under pressure while ensuring compliance with regulations and maintaining accurate records, skills that are invaluable in any professional setting.

Additionally, I gained practical exposure to the engineering sector during my tenure at Dannelli Engineering, where I focused on construction projects and material testing. This role deepened my understanding of project management and quality assurance in a dynamic environment.

Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I am passionate about the intersection of technology and innovation, particularly within the fintech space. I believe that leveraging technology can drive significant improvements in security and efficiency, and I am eager to contribute to this transformative journey. 

I am always open to networking and collaborating on projects that align with my interests in cybersecurity and technology. With a strong commitment to continuous learning and professional growth, I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead and am excited to make a positive impact in the tech industry
